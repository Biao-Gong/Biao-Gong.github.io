Artificial intelligence has guided video games since the very beginning, evolving from simple programmatic routines to systems for enemy reactions, route planning, and procedural item generation, shaping how games are created and experienced. Yet the progress of game technology and the progress of AI have not advanced together. Modern 3D engines and workflows are highly refined, and studios focused on AAA production still rely on AI mainly for supporting tasks such as NPC behavior, landform generation, and narrative control. This limits the development of AI-driven mechanics and prevents AI-centered games from forming a coherent paradigm. As a result, AI has not yet created a genuinely transformative gameplay experience. We believe the essence of gaming is interaction and entertainment. The lasting appeal of early classics such as Snake, Tetris, and Super Mario shows that playability precedes visual fidelity. Guided by this principle, our project aims to build an AI-native foundation for both game creation and play, targeting researchers shaped by the Transformer and data-driven deep learning paradigms. To advance this vision, we introduce AGG, a new class of AI-native games that currently includes physics-driven (pAGG), action-reaction (rAGG), and interactive-story (sAGG) games. For each type, we design specialized AI models that meet concrete gameplay needs, such as a physics-aware unified reinforcement learning framework for billiard games, and an animation generator tailored to multi-character scenes for music games. This project is driven by a team experienced in visual generation and multimodal understanding. We focus on adapting AI to interactive game settings, designing genuinely playable AI-centered games, and developing a clear road-map for model evolution. We welcome interest, discussion, and collaboration.
